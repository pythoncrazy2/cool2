To understand this condition, we must first look at the binary system in which mods' personal value are divided into: BASED and NOT BASED BASED mods are incapable of being influenced by adversary inflamatory or logically unsound arguments, known in the Discord realm as ""shit takes"", which makes them be accepted by the moderatees as having infallible morals. NOT BASED mods hold opinions and ethics that are easily corruptible and don't conform to the server's established rules of conduct, or general societal ethics. In light of this, by adding the element of sexual orientation, we come with the variants GAY AND BASED and GAY AND NOT BASED Contrary to its individual counterparts, these two designations hold the same steem from their peers. The first is logically unsound, as one that is ""GAY AND BASED"" automatically becomes ""GAY AND NOT BASED"", as that is the crucial deciding factor. Of course, this is not a desirable outcome for the mods, since the label of ""GAY AND NOT BASED"" implies that any opinion is immediately invalid, and any action they take is immediately wrong, rendering them as an example of undesirable state of being. CONCLUSION: Mods are ""GAY AND NOT BASED""'''"," '''No, YOU shut the fuck up. I'm tired of all these imbeciles who like flashing their cute little Discord roles around like they're not the abomination god tried to prevent from existing.

And don't ever challenge me again.'''","''CAN I STOP GETTING PINGED LEFT AND RIGHT?! THE BUTTON TO TURN OFF PINGS IS THERE, YOU BLITHERING IDIOT! STOP. PINGING. ME. WITH. EVERY. REPLY. I just don't want to be pinged for random or stupid crap. Is a little decency and respect too much to ask for? I don't care anymore. When people carelessly ping me knowing it pisses me off, it shows you have no morals whatsoever. On that note, who the fuck actually pinged me? Is it too much for ask some decency anymore? Seriously, if this continues, I'm either going to block everyone or leave. I was just minding my own damn business when I noticed the ping. I'm not gone, but I may just fucking do it because whoever keeps ghost pinging me has the mentality of a 9 year old. People have literally gotten to ghost pinging me just to annoy me. I. CAN. ONLY. DISABLE. EVERYONE. AND. ROLE. PINGS! Not normal pings! Also, learn how to turn off the reply pings, asshole. Or just, ya know... don't ping me for irrelevant or stupid stuff in general? I know I'm very late to this (blame me having to play through Spirit of Justice for this), but : 1. What was I pinged for? Unless the matter which I was pinged for was dealt with already... or if it was a stupid joke. 2. No, my pfp isn't from an anime, you pillocks. 3. ...there isn't such a thing as bad opinions. And even if there were, I could hit you back with your ""pins aren't BM"" argument, which is just as bad. Sod off. You all know how volatile I am to unnecessary pings. I can't stand unnecessary pings and unread messages. Like all of you are much better by willingly pinging me after I specifically told you not to MULTIPLE TIMES.

Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.'''","''Yeah yeah whatever. You expect me to say ""welcome"", right?

Look, before we get too deep into it I just want to take a sec to send a huge thank you to the beautiful people over at RAID SHADOW LEGENDS for sponsoring this video. Now you guys know I don’t usually take on sponsors, but I’ve been hearing a lot about this game recently, so I decided to throw some hours at it and give it a try, and I gotta say I’m really liking it so far. For those who don’t know RAID SHADOW LEGENDS is a free-to-play turn-based RPG that’s got like 15-million downloads over the last few months. Google Play even nominated it for an award for being one of its top RPG’s. It’s got a really cool story campaign, active PVP arenas, dungeons, 16 different factions, and hundreds and hundreds of heroes to collect and customize, and they add over a dozen new ones every single month. You can also unlock free champions, equipment, and other cool stuff just for learning how to play, which includes Arbiter (one of the best heroes in the game). As far as graphics go this game speaks for itself. It’s honestly kinda crazy how much detail these guys squeezed into a free game and for your phone, especially when you consider what used to pass for epic mobile gaming not so long ago. Anyway guys RAID SHADOW LEGENDS is constantly expanding and adding new features, so it’s really never a bad time to give it a try. And when you do make sure you go to the video description and use the special link there to get a free epic champion and 50,000 silver as part of their new player program.'''","''Welcome to Solo Showdown, we have Primo, oh look another Primo!

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.

I'm not gonna stop saying it until you give me one. This is absolutely unfair and very biased of you to treat your members this way. I've been very active here for a very long time, and have contributed more to this place than any other member, including mods.
I'm incredbly upset by this, how can you be like this??? If I was a mod I'd never treat any user this way. Imagine allowing someone into a server, having them engage in good faith and try to make it a better place for every user, only to be treated with dismissal when they ask a simple custom role.
