"So I've finally decided to end my toxic and quite sad relationship with Brawl Stars  I'm so tired of doing the same shit over and over again expecting different results.I'm tired of getting fucked in the mode "Primo Circlejerk" just because I dared to choose 1 of the other 50 or so brawlers and getting span on.I'm tired of brain dead teammates in 3v3 modes and Duos who'd rather do some meaningless quests than actually win the damn game.I'm tired of this community which is so stale  I'm tired of seeing a million posts about Collette  I'm tired of the same old 'random bad'joke  I'm tired of the fan boys who will defend this game at all costs just because they think Frank will give them 9999 gems.I'm tired of the garbage quality of maps (specifically in showdown).I'm tired of the "new" and repetitive brawlers which just feels like a combination of two or more older brawlers with maybe one brand new mechanic and quite frankly that will happen when you add about 12 brawlers a year(Supercell should add like 6 a year and give time to actually balance the fucking things).I'm tired of the garbage tier and flat out gross ships that delusional ppl insist are canon(you know what I'm talking about).I'm tired of Supercell adding broken shit that never gets balanced out i.E Surges teleport or the amount of super spam Stu can do.I'm tired of gadgets and some star powers throwing balance right out the window.I'm tired of grinding power league just so I feel that there's some point in the game but in reality I'm just grinding through all the pain that comes along P.L just to be able to buy a skin for someone I'm never going to play.I'm tired of only 10 brawlers being viable in 3v3."
